# Properly work sample

This repo contains my submission for the Properly work sample. All the code runs within the notebook. The requirements are the standard data science packages (numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn)

Instructions to run:
1. Clone repostiory
2. Open notebook
3. Run all cells


Within the notebook, I train a linear model, and then attempt to use it to prototype a Sale Assurance type product. I find the performance lacking, and train a second, Gradient Boosted Regressor model. I find it offers better performance, and would make a better prototype.
